The main goal of this project is to create a customized **Private Network**, as a way to understand how the Network actually work behind the scences, as I will be building this project backend by using **C Programming Language** as a way to build everything that from scratch to help strengthen my programming skills and problem solvings, however I will be also using react/next frameworks in order to develop a frontend for this private network to also work on what the market uses that is as an important as the backend. Therefore the aim and main purpose of this project is to learn system level programming with the front end side of programming.
